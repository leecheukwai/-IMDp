This is the code for article “Characterizing Rockfall dynamic parameters from Seismic Signals: Geometric Source Effects Meet Deep Learning-Driven Path Modeling”
The file "Separete_force.py" is for imapct model. Running this file directly generates the force history results for different nose shapes. To test the model under specific conditions, the input parameters of the corresponding impact model should be modified accordingly.
The file "VAE2.py" is for propagation model. Pretrained model parameters are available upon request. Please contact us via email at: wangdongpo@cdut.edu.cn
